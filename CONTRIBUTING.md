## How to Contribute Time

Individuals can contribute code, issues, or questions at any time. 

Corporations are encouraged to give time by allowing their staff to contribute to OIE with code, participation in the community, or other professional time. 

Entities working on larger issues or offering significant or recurring contributions of time are encouraged to [contact the OIE Steering Committee](https://openintegrationengine.org/contact/). This allows us to make the most of the contributed time for mutual benefit.


### Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug, please report it using the **GitHub Issues Tracker**:
1. **Search for existing issues** to check if the problem has already been reported.
2. If the issue is not listed, create a new issue with the following information:
   - A clear and descriptive title.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - The expected vs. actual behavior.
   - Any relevant logs, error messages, or screenshots to help diagnose the issue.

### Suggesting Features

If you would like to suggest a new feature or enhancement:
1. Open a new issue in the [**GitHub Issues Tracker**](https://github.com/OpenIntegrationEngine/engine/issues).
2. Label the issue as a **feature request**.
3. Provide a detailed description of the feature and the problem it aims to solve.
4. If applicable, include examples or use cases to demonstrate the value of the feature.


## How to Contribute Money

OIE has modest expenses for signing certificates, hosting, build minutes, and development tools. Our primary expense is human time for developing code and managing the project. Financial contributions will be applied to making OIE better.

Small individual donations are appreciated, however your individual time is often more valuable to us than your currency.

Corporations can contribute by:
* Investing money by paying or hiring developers [to contribute code](#how-to-contribute-code)
* Directly contributing to OIE [by contacting the OIE Steering Committee](https://openintegrationengine.org/contact/)
* Joining a sponsoring foundation. Learn which foundations are sponsoring the project [by contacting the OIE Steering Committee](https://openintegrationengine.org/contact/)

## How to Contribute Code

### 1. Open an Issue
Before making any changes, please open an issue in the [GitHub Issues Tracker](https://github.com/OpenIntegrationEngine/engine/issues). This step helps us discuss the problem or feature before work begins, ensuring alignment and reducing redundant efforts.

### 2. Fork the Repository
Start by forking the [Open Integration Engine GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenIntegrationEngine/engine) to your own GitHub account.

### 3. Clone Your Fork
Clone your fork locally to your development environment:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:OpenIntegrationEngine/engine.git
```

### 4. Make Changes
Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 5. Install Tooling
OIE specifies the working versions of Java and Ant in [.sdkmanrc](./.sdkmanrc). To take advantage of this, install [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/) and run `sdk env install`
in the project's root directory.

### 6. Implement your changes

Implement the necessary changes, ensuring they align with the projectâ€™s coding standards and practices.

### 7. Test Your Changes
Before submitting your changes, please ensure that all tests pass and that your changes work as expected in your local environment.

### 8. Submit a Pull Request
Once your changes are ready, push them to your fork and create a **draft pull request (PR)** from your branch to the `main` branch of the project. Draft PRs help indicate that the work is in progress.  
Mark the PR as **"Ready for review"** only when it is actually complete and ready for feedback. Include a brief description of the changes and reference the related issue.
